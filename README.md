  <h1>Creaturetopia</h1>

  <h3>The Idea</h3>
  <p>Back in late 2010 I had been playing multiple virtual animal games for several years. I enjoyed many of them greatly and decided I wanted to create my own.</p>
  <p>There were three sites that I enjoyed playing most, all of which were created, and origionally run, by the same person. These were <a href="http://www.kittentracks.com">Kitten tracks</a> (which is now closed), Horse Mogul (no longer existing), and <a href="http://www.animalacres.net/home">Aniaml Acres</a>. All these games were primarily text based, with no moving images or fancy graphics, but they had fairly large cative communities, and I decided to make my own game similar to these.</p>
  <p>After deciding this I Googled 'how to create a virtual animal game' and happend upon a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Virtual-Pet-Site">wikiHow page</a> (it has been updated since). The first thing it said was that you should not create one if you haven't been able to find one that quite fits what you want yet, so you want to make it, as these always fail. Instead you should create one that has it's own things that you want, but keeps many of the things other virtual animal site include.</p>
  <p>This sounded perfect, but it did make me question "What will be special about my site? How will it be differnt?" I thought of why I played animal games, and what I enjoyed about them. I enjoyed interacting with the other players, certainly, but that wasn't what had drawn me to such games in the first place. Finally I realised: having a person with pet allergies in the house meant there were many I couldn't own. Plus, they cost alot of money, which also put many out of the question. What was going to be differnet about my site? I was going to make a site that allowed you to own mythical animals. Perhaps, in the future, players would even be able to come up with their own breeds and species!</p>
  <h3>Learning Code</h3>
  </p>The next thing the wikiHow page said to do was learn a programming language such as Pearl. The other sites that I was basing mine on used PHP, according to the fine print at the bottom, and web addresses.</p>
  <p>wikiHow said it is a good idea to have a basic idea of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript first. I had no idea what these were, but Googled 'Learn HTML free online', and came acroos <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a>. Lucky for me it had courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. HTML and CSS were in their own section together, so I decided to start with them.  </p>
  <p>Over the last few months of 2010, and the first month of 2011, I learnt a little of HTML and CSS. I decided I would call my site Creaturetopia. I decided it's tile colour would be orange, and it's main background colour a light green, with maybe some darker greens as well. I created a homepage and rule page basic mock-up (both of which are long since gone). The one line I did remeber from my homepage and have kept as can be seen on my own site is "Doesn't exist? Not a problem!" which can be seen on my <a href="https://tinystep1.github.io/Creaturetopia/">current homepage</a> on GitHub.</p>
  <h3>The Dreaded Backburner</h3>
  <p>At this time (2011) I was enterning year 10, and starting to think about what courses I wanted to do for my senior year. In year 10, as many people - especially Australian's as that's the country I lived in (and still do) - are aware, you are given about a week to get back into the school routine with a little homework, course overviews, and such, and still time to do your own things. Then comes week two and within a day you will be slapped with about 3 assignments.</p>
  <p>As I had always been pushed to put my education first, above all else, and the workload had increased so much, I unfortunately had to put my coding studies on hold, to hopefully come back to after I'd finished High School.</p>
  <p>I finished High School in 2014, and applied to a few universities offering creative writing courses (another interest of mine), and coding courses. Of all those I applied for, I could only get in through a bridging course, so I decided to leave it for a year or two a get a job around home. Looking for work though, expecially in a low employment area, and even more so with the limited work experience of a High School student, proved to be a full time job. All my free time was put into resume updating, cover letter writing, aplying for job openings, handing in resumes at any business in town, drivng practice, and upskilling for desirable skills in all industries, and High School education level jobs in industries I was interested in. My dream of running my own virtual animal game was all, but forgotten...until 2019.</p>
  <h3>2Pi Software</h3>
  <p>In August one evening I attended a meeting about climate chnage.</p>
  <p>On my walk back to the car I started talking to one the other people who had been there. She asked me if I was interested in coding. This sparked the memory of the game I had wanted to create back in High School, and I eagerly replied that I was. She told me that 2Pi was looking for more women interested in coding, and tlod me where the office was, and that I should go see them.</p>
  <p>I happened to be in town the very next day. As I was eating lunch, I looked across the street. It just so happened that I was directly across the street from the office, and spotted the door saying 2Pi Software.</p>
  <p>When I had finished eating, I had some time before my next appointment, and went straight over to 2Pi Software. I told the people I spoke to in there what I had been told, that they were looking for more women interested in coding, and I was interested. They didn't have a lot of time that day, but they told me about a game programming course that they ran at the UOW (University Of Wollongong) campus each Wednesday, and the Networking night they had on the first Thursday of each month. They also arranged for me to come talk to them at the office each Tuesday at 12 so they could learn where I was at in terms of coding, and what I might need help with.</p>
  <p>I attended one of the game coding sessions to see if it would be helpful for me. I could see from the others work that I was no where near that level yet. However, I was introduced to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/login">Code Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.com</a> where I could continue learning HTML and CSS, and also learn JavaScript and PHP.</p>
  </p>During the rest of the week I went on freeCodeCamp, and also back to w3Schools, and started to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
